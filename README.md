📌 BondKeeper — AI-Powered Social Interaction Concierge Agent

🤝 BondKeeper is an AI agent designed to help individuals maintain healthy social relationships by analyzing conversations, understanding emotional intent, and generating empathetic replies in multiple tones (short, neutral, warm, and action-oriented).

This project is my capstone submission for the Google Agents Intensive Certification (2025) and is built using Gemini models + Python + Streamlit.

🚀 Features
🔹 Conversational Memory

Imports user conversations from a CSV

Stores them in a local SQLite database

Provides context-aware message suggestions

🔹 Empathetic AI Suggestions

For each contact, BondKeeper generates:

Short reply

Neutral reply

Warm emotional reply

Action suggestion (e.g., “Call him tomorrow”)

🔹 Streamlit Web UI

Clean, modern, colorful interface

CSV upload + contact management

One-click AI generation

Mock mode for demonstration without API costs

🔹 Flexible Backend

Gemini API powered

Fallback to mock JSON for demos

Fully open-source and reproducible

🏗️ Architecture Overview
